## Description
Project 3: Using Laravel to create a Developer's Best Friend Application.

## Details for teaching team
The live site is running on Pagodabox. Compared to what I've read on Piazza regarding OpenShift, Pagodabox has been very easy to work with. For each tool in the project, I used the Routes page to generate a string variable that is then passed to the View page. I used both the Lorem-Ipsum and Faker packages to generate the content. I also used the Bootstrap framework for the overall look of the application.
